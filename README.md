This repository contains Python code for modeling mortgage products using stochastic interest rate models and various mortgage payment schemes. In this project, we simulate interest rate paths using the Hullâ€“White model and use these paths to compute swap rates and mortgage profiles under different assumptions. Two primary mortgage models are implemented: the Bullet Mortgage and the Annuity Mortgage, each incorporating a stochastic prepayment mechanism.
